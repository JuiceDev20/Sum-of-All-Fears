#### Sum of All Fears Challenge

![](/Images/SumFears-tile3.png)


Good exercise to learn how to create functions that can reverse a string, this challenge was fun. 

The objective of this challenge is to determine whether a specified value, in our case k, is present in the data supplied. This time the array is given and a nested loop runs through array looking for the value of k.

Anyway, I hope you learn something new and please feel free to share your thoughts. 
Enjoy your day!
